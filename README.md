# Firebase onValue() Callback Not Executing

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onValue()` method: the callback function not executing despite data being present in the database.  The provided code snippet shows the issue, and the solution offers a troubleshooting approach.

## Problem

The application is designed to retrieve user data from a Firebase Realtime Database using `onValue()`.  However, the callback function within `onValue()` never executes, meaning no data is received from the database, even though data exists and is visible in the Firebase console.

## Solution

The solution focuses on common causes for this issue: incorrect database rules, authentication issues, and incorrect database references.  The solution code provides improved error handling and explicit checks for data existence.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase:
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```
3. Configure your Firebase project and replace placeholders in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` with your Firebase configuration.
4. Run the code and observe the console output.

This example focuses on troubleshooting, so ensure you have a correctly configured Firebase project and proper database rules in place.
